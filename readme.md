# CoreLib

Consider this library as productivity boost to achieve stated development goals faster in .NET.

# Pros

* field-proven solutions for everyday problems.
* doesn't add additional 3rd-party dependencies (beside itself of course).
* **open source** and **completely free** (MIT).
* faster development by reusing the provided solutions. The more you do it, the faster you'll go.
* And most important of all: Development feels even more like "**batteries included**".

# Cons

* CoreLib probably contains more features/solutions than required for your use case. 
  *Usually this con should not be a problem, but if a size optimized solution is required, extracting the used parts into the project could be a viable response to this drawback.* 

# Getting started

1. Install CoreLib via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Cap.Core/)
