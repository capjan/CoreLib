# ControlFlow

[Home](./README.md)

ControlFlow contains:
* [MultiAttempt Action/Func](./ControlFlow/MultiAttempt.md) - allows multipe attempts for a risky Action or Func\<T> before an error rises.
* [Tryify](./ControlFlow/Tryify.md) - reduces the required boiler plate code to write TryXxx functions by approx. 61.5 %.
